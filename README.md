# mp-utils
A collection of utility c++ functions that I've found useful. Some are of my own devising and some have been purloined from elsewhere, stackexchange has been particularly fruitful. If by chance you see some piece of code in here that you might have posted on stackexchange (or anywhere) ley me know and I'll add an attribution.
 
My grasp of Makefile syntax is still tenuous so you might find errors and other curiosities.

I think most of the code is self-explanatory.
